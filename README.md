# Guitar Tuner
A simple guitar tuner that I created as a final project for one of my introduction to programming classes. This only a software project so no gadgets needed.

## Usage

1. The tuner will start up and a message in the entry box will appear indicating to select a note or series of notes to play.
2. There will be a series of buttons for each musical note. To choose an individual note to play, the user simply clicks the button in which he/she wishes to play. After selecting a note, the user then needs to click the “Play Note” button and the note will play. The tuner will play the “E” note by default.
3. If the user wishes to select a series of notes to play the user simply types in the notes in the text box, separated by a comma. After typing in the selection the user will have to click the “Custom Tuning” button so the tuner plays the custom selection of notes.
4. The “Time” button allows the user to change the length of each note being played, the options are as follows:

[a] 3 seconds [b] 5 seconds [c] 10 seconds
